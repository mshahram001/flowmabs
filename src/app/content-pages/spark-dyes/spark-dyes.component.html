                                        provides researchers with the ability to fill spectral spaces between existing
                                        fluorophores, maximizing panel flexibilitySpark Dyes are advantageous due to

                                        relatively narrow emission profile, stability, and solubilityIn addition, their
                                        synthetic nature means they are not typically sensitive to standard fixatives,
